a cute metasearch engine

it sources from google, bing, brave, and a few others.

it's written in rust using no templating engine and with as little client-side
javascript as possible.

metasearch is a single binary with no cli or configuration file. if you want to
configure it (like to change the default port or weights of engines) then you
have to modify the source.

build it with `cargo b -r`, the resulting binary will be in `target/release/metasearch2`.
it runs on port 28019.
