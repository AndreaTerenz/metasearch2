a cute metasearch engine

it sources from google, bing, brave, and a few others.

there's a demo instance at https://s.matdoes.dev, but don't use it as your
default or rely on it, please (so i don't get ratelimited by google).

USAGE

build it with `cargo b -r`, the resulting binary will be at
`target/release/metasearch2`.

the config.toml file is created in your current working directory on the first
run of metasearch2. alternatively, you can copy the example-config.toml in the
repo and rename it to config.toml.

the default port is port 28019.

CONTRIBUTING

it's written in rust using no templating engine and with as little client-side
javascript as possible.
