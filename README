a cute metasearch engine

it sources from google, bing, brave, and a few others.

there's a demo instance at https://s.matdoes.dev, but don't use it as your
default or rely on it, please (so i don't get ratelimited by Google).

it's written in rust using no templating engine and with as little client-side
javascript as possible.

metasearch2 is a single binary with no cli, configuration file, or database.
if you want to configure it (like to change the default port or weights of
engines) then you have to modify the source.

build it with `cargo b -r`, the resulting binary will be at
`target/release/metasearch2`. it runs on port 28019.
